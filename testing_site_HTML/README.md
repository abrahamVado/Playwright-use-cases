# Tailwind HTML Examples for Playwright
Serve `site/` at `/` (e.g., `npx http-server site -p 3000`). These pages use **Tailwind via CDN** and keep all the
same selectors/roles your Playwright tests expect.

- Service worker mocks `/api/orders` and `/api/feed`.
- Pages: /, /dashboard, /checkout (with /payment-iframe.html), /booking, /settings, /products,
  /users/new, /orders, /signup, /profile, /profile/edit, /search, /pricing, /reports, /board, /account, /app, /product/123, /feed.
